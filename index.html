    <h1> Welcome to my Office Hours!</h1>
    <p>
        Hi again! I'd love to show ya'll something I found really cool that you can
        do with CSS. Although its a fairly nieche feature, im sure its worth looking
        at! It helped me see just how dynamic you can make a wepage with plain css!
    </p>

        Quick question, Whats your guys' favorite animal? Cool! My Favorite animals
        are sea slugs! I love them cuz they come in different shapes and 
        colors, and i think they're the cutest little things ever!
        Here, lemme put yall on.

        Pretty cool right? I love these little guys so much, and to be
        honest, I feel like these guys deserve more than just a plain 
        rectangle border on any random webpage. So let's do something 
        about it!
    </p>

    <h3> 
        * Until now, we've been using the border radius to do stuff like this. <br>
        However, We can do more than just background-color. *
    </h3>

            Lets make it up to the sea slugs shall we? Below is a picture of another type of sea slug, 
            this guy is a type of bare gill, nudibranch, sea slug.
